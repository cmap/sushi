Description: As an alternative to the Luminex bead-based PRISM assay, the PRISM
    Sequencing assay was developed for barcode detection with Next Generation
    Sequencing. Due to different output types from sequencers vs luminex
    scanners, the sushi data processing pipeline was developed to generate the
    analogous data levels from merino and espresso.
